# SakiHUD
SakiHUD - A heavily modified version of Garm3n VIP Konr with some funky colors!

# How to install:
1. Download the HUD from GitHub. It should download as a .zip file.  

2. Open the .zip file. Inside should be a folder named something like "SakiHUD-master".  

3. Open up that folder and inside should be two folders. SakiHUD and Customization. Drag the SakiHUD folder to steam > steamapps > common > Team Fortress 2 > tf > custom.

You should now be able to boot into your game and have the HUD load perfectly!

# How to use the customizations:
Inside of the .zip file that you initially downloaded, there a Customization folder. Inside of that folder is a bunch of customization presets that you can choose from ranging from different health meters to full on themes. To install them:
1. Open the folder for the customization you want to use. Drag the contents minus the screenshot into the base folder of the HUD that you installed inside of your custom folder.
Once you have done that, you should now be able to boot into your game without receiving any errors. Hopefully.

# How to enable a HUD crosshair:
1. Open up the scripts folder. Inside there should be some .res files and a folder labelled crosshair. Inside of that folder is a few other .res files for different HUD crosshairs including Garm3n's, fogcrosshairs and KnucklesCrosshes.

2. Open the .res file for the crosshair you want and set visible to "1" to make it show. If you want to change what the crosshair is on fog or KnucklesCrosses, I have included images and you just change the labeltext field to the corresponding character to get the crosshair that you want in game.

4. If you want to change the color of the crosshair, change the field "fgcolor" to whatever colour you want. The 4 numbers go RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA (e.g. 0 255 0 255 will give you a crosshair color of green with no transparency. If you want your crosshair to have some transparency for whatever reason, lower this number. Max is 255. Min is 0).

5. Once you're finished with whatever customisations you wanted, you're now free to save and close the .res file.

When you boot into your game, you should now see the crosshair that you chose be shown. It is recommended that you disable TF2's crosshair with "crosshair 0" and place that command inside of your cfg/autoexec so you don't have to keep putting that command into console every time you boot you game.
