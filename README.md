# SakiHUD
SakiHUD - A heavily modified version of Garm3n VIP Konr with some funky colors!

# How to install:
1. Download the HUD from GitHub. It should download as a .zip file.  

2. Open the .zip file. Inside should be a folder named something like "SakiHUD-master".  

3. Unzip that folder to steam > steamapps > common > Team Fortress 2 > tf > custom

You should now be able to boot into your game and have the HUD load perfectly!

# How to enable a HUD crosshair:
1. Open up the scripts folder. Inside should be a few .res files (if you have file extensions shown, then you will see .res at the end of the file name).

2. Open the .res file labelled "hudlayout.res". Inside will be a few HUD crosshair presets for you to choose from.

3. Find the one that you want and change the "enabled" field from "0" to "1" and save the .res file.

4. If you want to change the color of the crosshair, change the field "fgcolor" to whatever colour you want. The 4 numbers go RED GREEN BLUE ALPHA (e.g. 0 255 0 255 will give you a crosshair color of green with no transparency. If you want your crosshair to have some transparency for whatever reason, low this number. Max is 255. Min is 0).

5. Once you're finished with whatever customisations you wanted, you're now free to save and close the .res file.

When you boot into your game, you should now see the crosshair that you chose be shown. It is recommended that you disable TF2's crosshair with "crosshair 0".
